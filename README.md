This repository demonstrates a common but hard-to-debug issue in VBScript: cryptic errors when using the GetObject() function to access COM objects. The bug.vbs file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.vbs offers a solution that includes more robust error handling and path verification.  The issue arises from the lack of specific error messages when GetObject() fails, making it difficult to diagnose the root cause.  The solution employs error handling and more careful path management to improve the reliability and debuggability of the code.
